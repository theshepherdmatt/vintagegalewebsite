    <h2>The Gale 401<br>Restored, Not Reimagined</h2>

    <p>
      The Gale 401 was never designed to be fashionable — it was designed
      to be right. From its sealed cabinet and dual-woofer layout to its
      uncompromising stance on power and control, it remains one of the
      most distinctive British loudspeakers ever produced.
    </p>

    <p>
      At Vintage Gale, we restore these speakers with absolute respect for
      the original engineering. No modern reinterpretation. No cosmetic
      shortcuts. Just careful, methodical work that allows the design to
      speak for itself.

    <h2>The Gale Legacy</h2>
    <p>
      Founded in the 1970s at 23 Bruton Place in Mayfair, Gale Electronics was the vision of 
      Ira Gale, Jon Bannenberg, Billy Woodman, and David Lyth. Together, they created some 
      of the most iconic British hi-fi equipment ever made.
    </p>
    <p>
      The GS401 loudspeaker and GT2101 turntable became benchmarks of engineering excellence, 
      combining avant-garde industrial design with uncompromising acoustic performance.

    <h2>Our Restoration Philosophy</h2>
    <p>
      Every restoration begins with a thorough assessment. We document the condition 
      of each speaker, identifying worn components, driver damage, and cabinet issues. 
      Our goal is always to preserve the original design intent.
    </p>
    <p>
      From cabinet refinishing to crossover rebuilding, we use period-correct methods 
      and materials. Each step is documented, each component carefully handled. The 
      result is a speaker that performs exactly as it did when it left Bruton Place.
