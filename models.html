                <p>
                    The Gale GS401 was produced in three distinct variations, each with its own
                    character and following. From the iconic chrome caps to the rare walnut finish,
                    these speakers represent the pinnacle of 1970s British engineering.

                <h3>GS401A</h3>
                <p class="subtitle">The Chrome Icon</p>
                <p>
                    The most recognizable of the GS401 family, the GS401A features the signature
                    chrome-plated caps that became synonymous with the Gale brand. Designed by
                    Jon Bannenberg, these sculptural end caps were as much about industrial
                    design as acoustic function.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Key Features:</strong><br>
                    • Dual 8-inch woofers in sealed cabinet<br>
                    • 25mm soft-dome tweeter<br>
                    • Chrome-plated aluminum end caps<br>
                    • Power handling: 25-100 watts<br>
                    • Sensitivity: 89dB<br>
                    • Impedance: 8 ohms
                </p>
                <p>
                    The GS401A was designed to be driven hard by powerful amplifiers, with minimal
                    compression and exceptional transient response. Its sealed-box design provided
                    tight, controlled bass that defied its relatively compact dimensions.
                </p>

            <!-- GS401B - Rare Variation -->
            <div class="model-card">
                <img src="assets/images/401_image2.png" alt="Gale GS401B rare variation">
                <h3>GS401B</h3>
                <p class="subtitle">The Rare Variant</p>
                <p>
                    The GS401B represents a lesser-known chapter in the Gale story. While retaining
                    the fundamental acoustic architecture of the GS401A, this variant featured
                    alternative cosmetic treatments and is rarely encountered in the wild.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Distinguishing Characteristics:</strong><br>
                    • Modified end cap design<br>
                    • Alternative grille configuration<br>
                    • Same dual-woofer sealed cabinet<br>
                    • Identical driver complement to GS401A<br>
                    • Extremely limited production run
                </p>
                <p>
                    For collectors and enthusiasts, the GS401B is the holy grail. Its scarcity
                    and unique aesthetic make it one of the most sought-after British loudspeakers
                    from the era.
                </p>

            <!-- GS401C - Walnut -->
            <div class="model-card">
                <img src="assets/images/gs401c.jpg" alt="Gale GS401C with curved grille">
                <h3>GS401C</h3>
                <p class="subtitle">The Walnut Alternative</p>
                <p>
                    The GS401C featured a curved grille and refined styling while maintaining the same
                    uncompromising acoustic performance as the other variants. This model represented
                    the final evolution of the GS401 design, incorporating lessons learned from earlier
                    production runs.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Key Features:</strong><br>
                    • Real walnut veneer cabinet<br>
                    • Solid walnut end caps<br>
                    • Identical acoustic design to GS401A<br>
                    • Same driver configuration<br>
                    • Preferred by those seeking wood finish
                </p>
                <p>
                    The GS401C proved that the Gale sound was not tied to chrome and modernism.
                    This variant could blend into more traditional listening rooms while still
                    delivering the uncompromising performance Gale was known for.
