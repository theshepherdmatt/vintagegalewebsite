                <h1>The Restoration Process</h1>
                <p>
                    Restoring a Gale GS401 is not a casual undertaking. Each speaker receives
                    meticulous attention, with every component inspected, tested, and either
                    preserved or replaced with period-correct parts. This is restoration, not reimagination.

        <!-- PROCESS STEPS -->
        <section class="process-container">

            <!-- Step 1: Initial Assessment -->
            <div class="process-step">
                <div class="step-content">
                    <div class="step-number">1</div>
                    <h3>Initial Assessment</h3>
                    <p>
                        Every restoration begins with a comprehensive inspection. We photograph and
                        document the condition of the cabinets, drivers, crossovers, and hardware.
                        This assessment identifies all issues and establishes a restoration plan.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        We test the drivers individually, measure crossover component values, and
                        inspect the cabinet for structural integrity. This stage determines the
                        scope of work required to return the speaker to original specification.

            </div>

            <!-- Step 2: Cabinet Restoration -->
            <div class="process-step">
                <div class="step-content">
                    <div class="step-number">2</div>
                    <h3>Cabinet Restoration</h3>
                    <p>
                        Cabinet work is critical to both appearance and acoustic performance. We
                        carefully strip and refinish walnut veneers, or polish and restore chrome
                        caps to their original mirror finish.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Any damage to the sealed enclosure is addressed with precision joinery.
                        The goal is always to preserve original wood and hardware where possible,
                        intervening only where necessary to ensure structural integrity.
                    </p>
                </div>

            </div>

            <!-- Step 3: Driver Refurbishment -->
            <div class="process-step">
                <div class="step-content">
                    <div class="step-number">3</div>
                    <h3>Driver Refurbishment</h3>
                    <p>
                        The dual 8-inch woofers and soft-dome tweeter are the heart of the GS401.
                        We inspect surrounds, voice coils, and spiders for deterioration. Where
                        necessary, drivers are re-coned or rebuilt to original specifications.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Each driver is tested on the bench to ensure proper impedance, sensitivity,
                        and frequency response. Only when they meet original factory specifications
                        do they return to the cabinet.
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div class="step-image">
                    <img src="assets/images/DSCN0435.JPG" alt="Driver inspection and testing">
                </div>
            </div>

            <!-- Step 4: Crossover Rebuild -->
            <div class="process-step">
                <div class="step-content">
                    <div class="step-number">4</div>
                    <h3>Crossover Rebuild</h3>
                    <p>
                        Capacitors drift, resistors corrode, and inductors can fail. We rebuild
                        the crossover network using high-quality components that match the original
                        design values. Every solder joint is inspected and redone if necessary.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The crossover is the interface between amplifier and drivers. Getting it
                        right is non-negotiable. We use period-appropriate component types to
                        preserve the original sonic character.
                    </p>
                </div>

            <!-- Step 5: Final Testing -->
            <div class="process-step">

                    <div class="step-number">5</div>
                    <h3>Final Testing & Measurement</h3>
                    <p>
                        Before a restored pair leaves the workshop, we conduct extensive listening
                        tests and acoustic measurements. Frequency response, impedance curves,
                        and sensitivity are verified against original factory specifications.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        We run each speaker for several hours to ensure reliability. Only when
                        they meet our standards—and the standards set by Gale in the 1970s—are
                        they ready for delivery.
                    </p>

                    <h3>Packaging & Handover</h3>
                    <p>
                        Restored speakers are carefully packaged for safe transport. We provide
                        detailed documentation of all work performed, including photographs and
                        test measurements.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Each restoration includes a written report detailing replaced components,
                        refinishing work, and performance verification. Your GS401s return not
                        just restored, but documented for future owners.

                    If you own a pair of Gale GS401s in need of restoration, we'd love to hear
                    from you. Every restoration is unique, and we provide detailed quotes based
                    on the specific condition of your speakers.
